Title: "Intellectual Growth"

I have a [textbook on logic](http://amzn.to/1aJdedm), I found it at the
[dump](http://cmr.github.io/blog/2014/01/06/reading-old-things/) probably 3
years ago, during my second year of high school. I tried working through it
many times, but simply could not wrap my head around some of the concepts it
presents. In particular, I found its treatment of formal languages to be
very confusing. I could, for the most part, follow the material as I read it,
but attempting any of the exercises quickly became an exercise in futility.

Currently, I am in the so-called "Foundations" course (MA211) at my
[university](http://clarkson.edu/). Currently it is covering basic logic:
quantifiers, proofs, etc. Suddenly, I find myself able to tackle some of the
problems from the earlier textbook. Indeed, it is actually starting to make
sense. I find this feeling, the wave of understanding of a previously
impenetrable subject, very pleasant. It usually corresponds with a massive
increase in breadth of understanding, as I make connections to other subjects.
Hopefully I'll get these moments more often as I intensify my studies.

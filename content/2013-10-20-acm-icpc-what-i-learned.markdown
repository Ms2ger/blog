Title: ACM ICPC: What I Learned

Yesterday I participated in my first [programming
contest](http://icpc.baylor.edu/). It was very fun, though challenging, and I
learned a fair bit during it. <!-- more --> The content consisted of teams of
3 working to solve 6 problems as fast as possible. The problems ranged from
trivial (repeated arithmetic) to moderately complex.

## Problem solving is fun.

I already knew this, but it has been some time since I've done intense
problem solving. It was nice to sit down for a few hours and bang my head
on a problem. Creative problem solving just *feels* good, in a way that most
activities don't.

## I don't know much about algorithms or data structures

Of course I know the basic search and sorts, but anything involving
anything more complex than binary trees is beyond my current knowledge. A
few of the problems were solved very elegantly with tree operations. I was
unable to come up with a way to express the operation I wanted to perform.
It's a [standard problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem)
which I had not been aware of.

Now that I [know what I don't
know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns), I can expand my
knowledge.

## C++'s iostreams are quite nice

Previously I haven't been a fan of iostreams, due to their misplaced
pedagogical use. But, for simply reading whitespace-separated data from stdin
and outputting the same to stdout, there probably isn't anything easier. I
might implement something similar (though not using the `>>` and `<<`
operators).

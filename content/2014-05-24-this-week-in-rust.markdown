Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safe, concurrent, and fast. This is a weekly summary of its progress and
community. Want something mentioned? [Send me an

# What's cooking on master?

66 pull requests were merged this week.

## Breaking Changes

- `mem::uninit` [has been renamed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14392)
  to `uninitialized`, and everything in `mem` is either stable or deprecated
  (to be removed). There are a [bunch of other
  changes](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14259) to `mem` that go with
  this.
- All uses of `~str` [have been
  removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14310).
- `UnsafeArc` [has been removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14301),
  replaced with `Arc<Unsafe<T>>`.
- `Rng.choose` [now returns an
  `Option`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14319).
- `Bitv::init_to_vec` [has been
  removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14295).
- Test shards with the built-in test runner [are now indexed by
  1](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14286) in the CLI.
- `Result.unwrap_or_handle` [has been
  renamed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14294) to `unwrap_or_else` for
  consistency with `Option`.
- [Some miscellaneous renames in libcollections](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14279).
- rustc is [more strict](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14251) about
where it will accept a given `mod foo;` statement.

## Other Changes

There were a lot of various bugfixes and documentation additions all around.

- There is now support for [weak failure](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14293).
- The docs for the cell types [has been massively
  improved](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14304).
- `bytes!()` [now properly returns a static
  slice](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14275).
- A liballoc [has materialized](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/14230),
  that contains all allocation support

Category: This Week in Rust

Hello and welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust*!
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safe, concurrent, and fast. This is a weekly summary of its progress and
community. Want something mentioned? [Send me an
email!](mailto:corey@octayn.net?subject=This%20Week%20in%20Rust%20Suggestion)
Want to get involved? [We love
contributions](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Note-guide-for-new-contributors).

This issue combines this week and last, since I was very busy with school last
week, and did not have time to write.

# What's cooking on master?

153 pull requests were merged in the last two weeks.

## Breaking Changes

- Auto-rooting of `@` [has been
  removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13559). The exact fallout of
  this isn't obvious to me, but presumably this makes some uses of `@` not
  work.
- `std::task::task` [has been
  renamed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13675) to `TaskBuilder::new`.
- Closures can [no longer be
  applied](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13686) through a `&`-pointer.
  This fixes some memory unsafety.
- The `Round` trait [has been
  removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13597), and is now part of
  `Float`, and `Float` now takes things by-value.
- `Unsafe<T>` [is now always
  `Share`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13583), regardless of whether
  or not the contained type is `Share`.
- Modulo (`%` operator) on float types [has been
  removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13410), use the `rem` method
  instead.
- `~[T]` [is no longer growable](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13588).
- Some `Bitv` method names [have
  changed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13572).
- The `priv` keyword [is no longer
  used](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13547), but is still reserved.
- Some cases where destructors were not run [have been
  fixed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13390).
- `unwrap` and `unwrap_err` on `Result` [now require the wrapper type to
  implement `Show`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13479).
- Some return types in `std::comm` [have been made
  consistent](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13448).

## Other Changes

- There is now a [pure-Rust regular expression
  library](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13700) in the standard
  library. As I've come to expect from burntsushi, the docs are fantastic.
- [Unix sockets](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13723) and [TCP
  sockets](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13688) now support accept with
  a timeout. [TcpStream::connect](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13604) can also
  take a timeout.
- [64-bit Windows is now partially
  supported](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13692). Unwinding still
  doesn't work.
- `&&` [is now parsed as `& &`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13576)
  when appropriate.
- Errors about use of moved values [are much nicer
  now](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13418).
- Cloning vectors [is now much much
  faster](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13539).
- SipHash [has also been
  optimized](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13522).
- Steve Klabnik's 30 minute introduction to Rust [has been added as official
  documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/13416).

  ago](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/Meeting-weekly-2014-04-15), a
  bunch of RFCs were discussed, as well as a breaking change log.
- [Last week], some more RFCs were discussed, notably the regex crate, numeric
  type inference, and disableable asserts.

# RFCs

- [Linker placement attribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/44)
- [Avoiding integer overflow](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/45)
- [Writer size hints](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/46)
- [Revised trait matching](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/48)
- [Disableable assertions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/50)

- [Coroutines](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/53)

# Community Updates

- For all Mac users, there is now
  [dash-rust](https://github.com/indirect/dash-rust/), for Rust API docs in
  Dash.
- Another [Rust By Example](http://rustbyexample.github.io/) has been created.
  This one is much more complete and also looks pretty nice.
- [Teepee](http://chrismorgan.info/blog/introducing-teepee.html) has been
  announced, the successor to `rust-http`.
- [zinc](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-April/009618.html),
  a bare-metal Rust stack.
- [An IntelliJ Rust plugin](https://github.com/Vektah/idea-rust).

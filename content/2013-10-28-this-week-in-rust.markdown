Welcome to another issue of *This Week in Rust!* This week marks the addition
of some more feature gates, removal of `std::io`, and some feature proposals.

<!-- more -->

# What's cooking on master?

47 PRs were merged this week, and we passed issue number 10000.

## Breaking Changes

- Most of the crypto in the stdlib [has been
  removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9744).
- `std::io` [has been removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9901),
  with corresponding improvements in `std::rt::io`.
- The `frame_address` intrinsic [has been
  removed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10040).
- `@`-ptrs are [now feature-gated](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9923),
  reflecting the fact that they will exist in a very different form once they
  are finished.
- All of the logging that used `fmt` (`debug!` and so forth) [have been
  transitioned to `format!`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10006).
- `asm!` [is also featured gated](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10009).
- `sys::log_str` [has moved](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9937).

## Other changes

- The long-awaited addition of `mut` in patterns [has finally
  happened](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10026). `let (mut x, y) = (1,
  2);` works.
- The scheduler now uses [lock free data
  structures](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10080), which are supposed
  to perform much better.
- The homing code [now does less
  work](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10070), which does one third as
  many `write`'s.
- `stdout` [is now buffered](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10060).
- A [non-libuv event loop](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10054) has
  been added.
- `std::rand` has seen [more](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9810)
  [work](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/10015).
- `rustpkg` [now supports arbitrary
  dependencies](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9654), such as C
  libraries.
- `mut` is [now allowed on self](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9989).
- Nested comments [are now
  allowed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9936).
- `rustpkg` will now [find crates in the current directory], so you can say
  `rustpkg build` in a source dir and it will build in a workspace.
- Some new float intrinsics [have been
  exposed](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9986).
- `println!` [allocates less](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pull/9979).

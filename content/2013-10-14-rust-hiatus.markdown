Title: Rust Hiatus

Category: Personal

I'm taking a temporary hiatus from all Rust work, to focus on academics. This
includes IRC and <http://docs.octayn.net>. I will continue to publish This
Week in Rust. If you need to contact me for any reason, please
[mailto:corey@octayn.net](send me an email).
